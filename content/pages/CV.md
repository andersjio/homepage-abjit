### DevOps Engineer (freelance)

Mar 2022 - Present\
Shure Nordic (renewed 2 times)

Joined the globally distributed internal DevOps team with a focus on providing assistance and support for CI/CD tasks and helping the team getting started in AWS. My key responsibilities involved enhancing and scaling the team's internal build (CI) capacity utilizing AWS infrastructure. Additionally, I implemented a proof-of-concept for dynamically scaling infrastructure using EKS deployed with AWS CDK.

In addition to these, I actively contributed to routine DevOps and CI/CD tasks while driving general improvements in these domains. Since autumn 2023, I played a vital role in the development of an internal CLI tool utilizing Python and the Typer CLI framework. This CLI served as a unifying solution for streamlining CI/CD operations throughout the organization.


**Tools and technologies:** Jenkins, Python, EKS, NPM, Bitbucket, Confluence & Jira 

**Projects**: 
- Designed and implemented an internal Dockerhub clone (Python)
- Improved observability across the CI/CD stack using Grafana
- Enabled Jenkins to utilize EKS (dynamic build farm)
- Reduced legacy code within the Devops team
- Deployed services to ECS using AWS CDK (Python)
